## 2025-12-13 - Spell Level Display vs Reality
**Insight:** The Grimoire UI displayed spell level bonuses (+10% damage per level) but the combat system never applied this multiplier. Players leveled spells believing they were getting stronger, but damage remained unchanged.

**Guideline:** Always verify that UI-displayed stats (especially progression systems) are actually used in game logic. Test by comparing displayed values against actual combat output.
